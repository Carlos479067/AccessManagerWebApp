<h1>Access Manager Web Application</h1>
<p>This project was created for mail carriers to have access to all gate codes, mail room codes, parcel locker codes, and neighborhood codes on their mobile device. 
  This saves the carrier time by not having to call management in the case of not knowing a certain routes codes.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>
<p>This web application features a simple and straight forward home interface, which shows routes labeled and organized by zip code.
The header features updated weather statistics from openWeatherAPI to display the temperature to the carrier.
The navbar features a search function, where the user can search by address or neighborhood name for quick lookups.</p>
